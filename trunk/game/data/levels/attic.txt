LOOKY: train_box: You like trains.
LOOKY: kozy_koupe: Paradise by the plastic dashboard|sticker light.
LOOKY: saturnalia_box: Mom was kind of weird
LOOKY: sports_box: Lots of memories playing games with|your parents here, though in some|cases you had to get creative, like|for three person football.
LOOKY: misc_box: All the odds and ends that don't|really have a place, but you couldn't|bear to get rid of either. 
LOOKY: lego_box: These got banished to the attic after|the extremely unfortunate Stairwell|Caper of '97; Aunt Edna's|Pomeranian, what was left of it, is|buried somewhere in your backyard|and she still walks with a limp and|refuses to speak to you.
LOOKY: games_box: Significantly less scarring than the|box labelled "Fun & Games" you|found in your parents' bedroom.
LOOKY: basketball: You're not even sure why this is up|here; you always hated basketball,|ever since Susie Halford beat the|snot out of you on the court in the|7th grade. Girl was 5'2" but|had a mean right elbow she knew|just when to use, and you ended|up puking in front of the|cheerleaders.
